# Slices


This Unity project was made for _Space.URI, with the intent that students studying biology and or are in the medical field would be able to make use of it.  There are slices of a body lined up and in VR one could pick one up, examine it more closely, and put it back where it belongs in the body.  One can also spread the slices out by using the grips, on a Vive controller, and moving their arms apart, or move them closer by using the grips and moving their arms closer, with specific limits for both actions.  *This project was created with a 2017 version of Unity and VR tools, and may not work in with an updated engine and tools.
